## How long are therapy sessions and how often do I need to attend sessions?

Therapy has been found to works best when it is attended at least 1 time per week for the first couple weeks of therapy. As such, I ask that new clients attend sessions at least 1 time a week for the first 4-5 weeks, in order for us to begin building a therapeutic relationship, and work on a plan so you can begin to achieve your goals in therapy. When this is accomplished, we will discuss and evaluate how often you should come in to therapy and adjust your sessions accordingly.

## What is the first session like?

During the first session, we will begin to get to know one another and I will learn more about your history and your goals for therapy through an Intake. An Intake is a series of questions, which allows me to assess whats going on with you, and allows me to evaluate the issues that may need to be worked on. 

## How much does therapy cost?

The initial intake session is $150. Individual 50-minute sessions are $125. I have a limited amount of sliding scale openings based on financial need.

## How does payment work?

Payment is collected at the time of the appointment. I accept cash or credit cards. 

## Do you accept insurance?

At this time I do not accept insurance.

## Do you have a cancellation policy?

Yes. I ask for a minimum of 24 hours notice if you need to cancel a session. If you fail to attend a scheduled session or give less than 24 hours notice of cancellation, your full fee will be charged to the credit card on file. 

## Where are you located?

I am located at [9732 West Sample Road, Coral Springs, FL 33065](https://goo.gl/maps/xz1PZA494Tz). My office is on the second floor of the building. When you arrive for your appointment please knock on the front door, and I will come greet you!
