## How long are therapy sessions and how often do I need to attend sessions?

Therapy works best when it is attended at least 1 time per week for the first couple weeks of therapy. I ask that new clients attend sessions at least 1 time a week for the first 4-5 weeks to build a therapeutic relationship and work on a plan so you can begin to achieve your goals. When this is accomplished, we will discuss and evaluate how often you should come in to therapy and adjust your sessions accordingly.

## What is the first session like?

During the first session, we will begin to get to know one another and I will learn more about your history and your goals for therapy through an intake. An intake is a series of questions which allows me to assess what's going on with you and to evaluate the issues that need to be worked on. 

## How much does therapy cost?

The initial intake session is $150. Individual 50-minute sessions are $125. I have a limited amount of sliding scale openings based on financial need, and for those impacted by Covid-19.

## How does payment work?

Payment is collected at the time of the appointment. I accept payment by cash or credit card. 

## Do you accept insurance?

While I don't accept most insurances, if you have a PPO policy and have out of network benefits I can provide you with a superbill to submit to your insurance. If you have met your out of network deductible, most insurance companies will reimburse you for a portion of your session fee.

## Do you have a cancellation policy?

Yes. I ask for a minimum of 24 hours notice if you need to cancel a session. If you fail to attend a scheduled session or give less than 24 hours notice of cancellation, your full fee will be charged to the credit card on file. 

## Where are you located?

Currently all sessions are being conducted online using a HIPAA compliant video platform. When I do return to the office I am located at [9732 West Sample Road, Coral Springs, FL 33065](https://goo.gl/maps/xz1PZA494Tz). My office is on the second floor and easily accessible to local surrounding areas such as Parkland, Coconut Creek, Tamarac, Plantation, Boca Raton, and Delray Beach. When you arrive for your appointment, please knock on the front door or ring the doorbell and I will greet you!
