## OCD can make you feel trapped and doubt yourself

Do you have **obsessive thoughts about contamination from germs, losing control, morality, or hurting others**? Are these thoughts so upsetting or distressing that they lead you to engaging in **rituals, otherwise known as compulsions**, such as washing your hands a specific number of times, counting, doubting yourself, or checking things repeatedly. If so, you may feel like you're trapped, as these obsessions and compulsions may take up hours of your day and lead to feelings of helplessness, as you are at the mercy of your compulsions. 

Luckily, with the right help, control over your obsessions and compulsions is possible. Utilizing an evidence based behavioral technique called **Exposure and Response Prevention**, you can learn how to manage and eliminate your OCD  so you can live life on your terms.

While combating OCD is tough, given the **right tools and strategies** you can find yourself on the way to being in control of your life again. Working together we will create a plan that will allow you to address your OCD fears in a safe, comfortable space, where treatment is designed to go at your pace. 

My practice is located in Coral Springs, FL. For those who either live too far away or are unable to make it to the office, treatment with me is still possible through **online therapy** which is offered to anyone who lives in Florida.
