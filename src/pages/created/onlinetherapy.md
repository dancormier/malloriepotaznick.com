## Easy, Convenient, and Secure

It can be difficult, for varying reasons, to make it into the office for an appointment. Due to the busy schedules of people and their families today, it has become **essential** to find **alternative ways** to make **therapy accessible and convenient to access.** 

## Enter online therapy

I have to say I was a little skeptical about offering online therapy when I first heard about it. I was scared that I wouldn't be able to connect with my clients online in the same manner I’m able to when I meet them face to face in my office. After being assured by other colleagues who had ventured into the world of online therapy, I decided to take the leap into offering therapy online and I'm glad I did.

I've learned, not only have I been **able to connect with my clients online as well as I do with the clients who come to my office**, but I have **found a multitude of ways** that my **clients have benefited** from providing them with my services online, such as being able to do sessions when their schedules are busy, when they don’t have access to a transportation, or when they are apprehensive to travel through bad weather. For others, the **convenience of being able to do sessions in the comfort of their own home** has made the prospect of doing therapy less anxiety inducing. Whatever the reason, online therapy allows me to **provide quality care and support** to those who need it **anywhere in the state of Florida**. This has allowed me to provide my services to those who may be in areas where they do not have access to the mental health care they need or do not have access to quality specialists in eating disorders, anxiety, or OCD. 

## Engaging in sessions online is easy

You don’t need to be an expert in computers or even download any software. Using a HIPPA compliant secure Telehealth platform, all you need is **a decent internet connection, a device such as a laptop, phone or tablet, and a quiet, private location to talk in**. I will send you a link to my online virtual office and all you have to do is click join to begin receiving the same benefits of in-person therapy at your convenience! To learn more about online therapy, or to try it out the online platform to see if its right for you, I provide a 15 minute video consultation for free.
