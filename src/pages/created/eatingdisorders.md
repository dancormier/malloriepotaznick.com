## Eating disorders can be exhausting and lonely

Having an eating disorder can be exhausting and lonely. It may feel at times as if your whole life has become consumed with thoughts about your weight, what you look like, your flaws, how others perceive you, what to eat during your binge sessions or how many calories you consumed that day. You may feel like you have little time to worry or think about anything else in your life, as you become **trapped in the constant cycle of anxiety, fear, shame, and guilt.**

When you have an eating disorder the first thought you have each morning usually involves food or your body, and yet tends to be the last thing you want to discuss with anyone. It may feel **isolating** as you hide the symptoms of your disorder from your friends or family, or tell the people in your life, only to find that they don’t truly understand what its like to have an eating disorder.

## You're not alone

Many people **struggle** with issues concerning their **body image**, and **relationship to food**, they just don’t talk about it. It's not easy for people to discuss or even acknowledge they have an eating disorder. Who wants to admit they're struggling? 

## What do eating disorders look like?

Eating disorders don’t have a **LOOK**, and  can affect anyone regardless of their weight, and physical appearance. **Physical appearances** at times can be deceiving. Just because someone is skinny doesn’t mean they're suffering from anorexia nervosa, nor does it mean if someone is heavier that they have a binge eating disorder. In fact, **appearances** can be **deceiving**.  Someone who looks physically healthy may be restricting what they eat, calorie counting, or could be struggling with bulimia, binge-eating disorder, and body dysmorphia.
