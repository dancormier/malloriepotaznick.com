## Eating Disorders

Having an eating disorder can be exhausting and lonely. It may feel at times as if your whole life has become consumed with thoughts about your weight, what you look like, your flaws, how others perceive you, what to eat during your binge sessions or how many calories you consumed that day. You may feel like you have little time to worry or think about anything else in your life, as you become trapped in the constant cycle of anxiety, fear, shame, and guilt. 

When you have an eating disorder food is usually the first thought you have each morning and is the last thing you want to talk about with anyone. It may feel isolating as you hide the symptoms of your disorder from your friends or family, or tell the people in your life, only to find that they don’t truly understand what its like to have an eating disorder. You're not alone. Many people struggle with issues concerning their body image, and relationship to food, they just don’t talk about it. Whether you have been diagnosed with an eating disorder or are just beginning to notice symptoms of an eating disorder, therapy with an individual like me, who specializes in eating disorders can help. During therapy we will look at your disordered eating patterns, and your emotions and find and work through the underlying causes of your eating disorder so that you can become healthy and regain control of your life again.
