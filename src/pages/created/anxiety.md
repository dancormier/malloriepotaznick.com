## Anxiety is uncomfortable

Anxiety often happens during the worst possible times, and can be quite difficult to get under control once it's gotten a hold of you.

 For instance, have you ever been walking down the street, not a care in the world when suddenly you begin noticing an uncomfortable sensation in your body, or a stray thought, which comes to the forefront of your mind? You try to ignore this sensation or thought but your mind begins to focus in on whats going on in your mind and body, and within seconds your completely entrapped by the rapid and repetitive racing thoughts of what’s wrong with you, and why your feeling the way you are. You begin then to go down the rabbit hole of what if’s, as you try to figure out what caused the random thought or uncomfortable body sensation in the first place. As fear and panic are setting in, your body begins to show physical signs that begin to worry you even more as your heart-rate increases, you experience shortness of breathe, become dizzy and/or begin sweating. If you’ve experienced this scenario then you know the **feeling of discomfort** that **anxiety **provides all too well unfortunately.
