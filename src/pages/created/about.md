Hi, I’m Mallorie. For the last few years I’ve worked with adolescents, young adults, adults and couples to transform their anxiety, frustration, fears, and emotional disconnection into opportunities for change. Change is tough and making the choice to get out of your comfort zone and try something new can be scary. I help people learn more about why they do the things they do, what keeps them stuck, and why they cope in sometimes unhealthy ways. Let me guide you on your journey and help you move through your discomfort, and learn new coping skills, while helping you process through your painful feelings. It’s time to make a change. Call me for a free 20 minute consultation and together we can figure out where your journey begins.
