      ##### Anxiety


      Occasional anxiety is an expected part of life. You might feel anxious
      when faced with a problem at work, before taking a test, or before making
      an important decision. But anxiety disorders involve more than temporary
      worry or fear. For a person with an anxiety disorder, the anxiety does not
      go away and can get worse over time.


      ##### Eating Disorders


      There is a commonly held view that eating disorders are a lifestyle
      choice. Eating disorders are actually serious and often fatal illnesses
      that cause severe disturbances to a person’s eating behaviors. Obsessions
      with food, body weight, and shape may also signal an eating disorder.


      ##### Other Specialties


      In addition to anxiety and eating disorders, I have an extensive
      background treating addition, autism, and some other things I’ll go over
      in another novel. What’s the last book you’ve read? What’s the last meal
      you’ve eaten? How about the last movie you’ve seen? If you want answers to
      these questions and so many others, hook yourself up to an e-meter and
      have a spin at some pseudoscience. Wait, that’s something else.
