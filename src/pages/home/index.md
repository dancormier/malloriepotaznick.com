      Hi, I’m Mallorie Potaznick, a Licensed Mental Health Counselor based out
      of Coral Springs, FL. For the last few years I’ve worked with adolescents,
      young adults, adults and couples to transform their anxiety, frustration,
      fears, and emotional disconnection into opportunities for change. Change
      is tough and making the choice to get out of your comfort zone and try
      something new can be scary. I help people learn more about why they do the
      things they do, what keeps them stuck, and why they cope in sometimes
      unhealthy ways. Let me guide you on your journey and help you move through
      your discomfort, and learn new coping skills, while helping you process
      through your painful feelings. It’s time to make a change. Call me for a
      free 20 minute consultation and together we can figure out where your
      journey begins.

          Do you constantly feel worried, nervous, or unease over situations or
          events happening in your life? Are you always on edge? Anxiety affects
          over 40 million people everyday. Don't let it consume your life any
          longer. Therapy will provide you with the tools to be able to
          identify, challenge, and change the thoughts and behaviors that
          trigger your anxiety.

          # Eating Disorders

          <img src="/img/i-yunmai-617618-unsplash.jpg" alt="image-description"

          Food and the way you look is a source of contention for you. You're
          constantly worrying about your body and how much and what you've
          eaten, and have resorted to restricting what you eat, binge eating,
          counting calories and/or purging. You feel like you've tried
          everything to get your disordered eating habits under control to no
          avail, and you're left with feelings of frustration, shame, and guilt
          over your behaviors. You're not alone! With the help of therapy you
          can learn to gain back the control that eating disorder voice has
          stolen from you, and gain freedom again!

          background treating chronic stress, depression, addiction, autism, and
          grief.
