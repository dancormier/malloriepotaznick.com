          Occasional anxiety is an expected part of life. You might feel anxious
          when faced with a problem at work, before taking a test, or before
          making an important decision. But anxiety disorders involve more than
          temporary worry or fear. For a person with an anxiety disorder, the
          anxiety does not go away and can get worse over time.

          There is a commonly held view that eating disorders are a lifestyle
          choice. Eating disorders are actually serious and often fatal
          illnesses that cause severe disturbances to a person’s eating
          behaviors. Obsessions with food, body weight, and shape may also
          signal an eating disorder.

          In addition to anxiety and eating disorders, I have an extensive
          background treating addition, autism, and some other things I’ll go
          over in another novel. What’s the last book you’ve read? What’s the
          last meal you’ve eaten? How about the last movie you’ve seen? If you
          want answers to these questions and so many others, hook yourself up
          to an e-meter and have a spin at some pseudoscience. Wait, that’s
          something else.
