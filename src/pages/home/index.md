      Hi, I’m Mallorie Potaznick, a Licensed Mental Health Counselor based out
      of the Coral Springs and Parkland, FL area. For the last few years I’ve
      worked with adolescents, young adults, adults and couples to transform
      their anxiety, disordered eating patterns, depression, frustration, fears,
      and emotional disconnection into opportunities for change. Change is tough
      and making the choice to get out of your comfort zone and try something
      new can be scary. As a therapist, I help people learn more about why they
      do the things they do, what keeps them stuck, and why they cope in
      sometimes unhealthy ways. Let me guide you on your journey and help you
      move through your discomfort, and learn new coping skills, while helping
      you process through your painful feelings. It’s time to make a change.
      Call today for a free 20 minute therapy consultation and together we can
      figure out where your journey begins.

          Food and the way you look is a source of frustration and stress for
          you. You're constantly worrying about your size and shape, how much
          and what you've eaten, and have resorted to restricting what you eat,
          binge eating, counting calories and/or purging. You feel like you've
          tried everything to control your disordered eating habits  and are
          desperate to find relief.
