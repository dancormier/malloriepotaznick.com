      Hi, I’m Mallorie Potaznick, a Licensed Mental Health Counselor based out
      of the Coral Springs and Parkland, FL area. For the last few years I’ve
      worked with adolescents, young adults, adults and couples to transform
      their anxiety, disordered eating patterns, depression, frustration, fears,
      and emotional disconnection into opportunities for change. Change is tough
      and making the choice to get out of your comfort zone and try something
      new can be scary. As a therapist, I help people learn more about why they
      do the things they do, what keeps them stuck, and why they cope in
      sometimes unhealthy ways. Let me guide you on your journey and help you
      move through your discomfort, and learn new coping skills, while helping
      you process through your painful feelings. It’s time to make a change.
      Call today for a free 20 minute therapy consultation and together we can
      figure out where your journey begins.

          Do you constantly feel worried, nervous, or unease over situations or
          events happening in your life? Are you always on edge? Do you struggle
          with OCD, panic attacks, or socializing? Anxiety affects over 40
          million people everyday. Don't let it consume your life any longer.
          Counseling will provide you with the tools to be able to identify,
          challenge, and change the thoughts and behaviors that trigger your
          anxiety.

          # Eating Disorders


          <img src="/img/i-yunmai-617618-unsplash.jpg" alt="image-description"
          />

          Food and the way you look is a source of frustration and stress for
          you. You're constantly worrying about your body size and shape, how
          much and what you've eaten, and have resorted to restricting what you
          eat, binge eating, counting calories and/or purging. You feel like
          you've tried everything to get your disordered eating habits under
          control to no avail, and you're left with feelings of frustration,
          shame, and guilt over your behaviors. You're not alone! With the help
          of counseling you can learn to gain back the control that eating
          disorder voice has stolen from you, and attain freedom again!
