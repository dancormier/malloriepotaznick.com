      Hi, I’m Mallorie Potaznick, a Licensed Mental Health Counselor based out
      of Coral Springs, FL. For the last few years I’ve worked with adolescents,
      young adults, adults and couples to transform their anxiety, disordered
      eating patterns, frustration, fears, and emotional disconnection into
      opportunities for change. Change is tough and making the choice to get out
      of your comfort zone and try something new can be scary. I help people
      learn more about why they do the things they do, what keeps them stuck,
      and why they cope in sometimes unhealthy ways. Let me guide you on your
      journey and help you move through your discomfort, and learn new coping
      skills, while helping you process through your painful feelings. It’s time
      to make a change. Call me for a free 20 minute consultation and together
      we can figure out where your journey begins.

          Do you constantly feel worried, nervous, or unease over situations or
          events happening in your life? Are you always on edge? Anxiety affects
          over 40 million people everyday. Don't let it consume your life any
          longer. Counseling will provide you with the tools to be able to
          identify, challenge, and change the thoughts and behaviors that
          trigger your anxiety.

          # Eating Disorders


          <img src="/img/i-yunmai-617618-unsplash.jpg" alt="image-description"
          />

          Food and the way you look is a source of frustration and stress for
          you. You're constantly worrying about your body size and shape, how
          much and what you've eaten, and have resorted to restricting what you
          eat, binge eating, counting calories and/or purging. You feel like
          you've tried everything to get your disordered eating habits under
          control to no avail, and you're left with feelings of frustration,
          shame, and guilt over your behaviors. You're not alone! With the help
          of counseling you can learn to gain back the control that eating
          disorder voice has stolen from you, and attain freedom again!

          autism, and grief.
