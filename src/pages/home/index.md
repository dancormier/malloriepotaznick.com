      Hi, I’m Mallorie. For the last few years I’ve worked with adolescents,
      young adults, adults and couples to transform their anxiety, frustration,
      fears, and emotional disconnection into opportunities for change. Change
      is tough and making the choice to get out of your comfort zone and try
      something new can be scary. I help people learn more about why they do the
      things they do, what keeps them stuck, and why they cope in sometimes
      unhealthy ways. Let me guide you on your journey and help you move through
      your discomfort, and learn new coping skills, while helping you process
      through your painful feelings. It’s time to make a change. Call me for a
      free 20 minute consultation and together we can figure out where your
      journey begins.

      # Anxiety

      Do you constantly feel worried, nervous, or unease over situations or
      events happening in your life? Are you always on edge? Anxiety affects
      over 40 million people everyday. Don't let it consume your life any
      longer. Therapy will provide you with the tools to be able to identify,
      challenge, and change the thoughts and behaviors that trigger your
      anxiety.

      # Eating Disorders/Body Dysmorphia

      Food and the way you look is a source of contention for you. You're
      constantly worrying about your body and how much and what you've eaten,
      and have resorted to restricting what you eat, binge eating, counting
      calories and/or purging. You feel like you've tried everything to get your
      disordered eating habits under control to no avail, and you're left with
      feelings of frustration, shame, and guilt over your behaviors. You're not
      alone! With the help of therapy you can learn to gain back the control
      that eating disorder voice has stolen from you, and gain freedom again!

      background treating chronic stress, depression, addiction, autism, and
      grief.
