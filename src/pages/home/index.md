      Hi, I’m Mallorie. For the last few years I’ve worked with adolescents,
      young adults, adults and couples to transform their anxiety, frustration,
      fears, and emotional disconnection into opportunities for change. Change
      is tough and making the choice to get out of your comfort zone and try
      something new can be scary. I help people learn more about why they do the
      things they do, what keeps them stuck, and why they cope in sometimes
      unhealthy ways. Let me guide you on your journey and help you move through
      your discomfort, and learn new coping skills, while helping you process
      through your painful feelings. It’s time to make a change. Call me for a
      free 20 minute consultation and together we can figure out where your
      journey begins.

      ## Anxiety


      Anxiety often happens during the worst possible times, and can be quite
      difficult to get under control. For instance, have you ever been walking
      down the street, not a care in the world when suddenly you begin noticing
      an uncomfortable sensation in your body, or a stray thought, which comes
      to the forefront of your mind. You try to ignore this sensation or thought
      but your mind begins to focus in on whats going on in your mind and body,
      and within seconds your completely entrapped by the rapid and repetitive
      racing thoughts of what’s wrong with you, and why your feeling the way you
      are. You begin then to go down the rabbit hole of what if’s, as you try to
      figure out what caused the random thought or uncomfortable body sensation
      in the first place. As fear and panic are setting in, your body begins to
      show physical signs that begin to worry you even more as your heart-rate
      increases, you experience shortness of breathe, become dizzy and/or begin
      sweating.  If you’ve experienced this scenario then you know the feeling
      and discomfort that anxiety provides all to well unfortunately. Luckily
      therapy can help alleviate anxiety. Together, I will help you discover the
      underlying causes of your anxiety, provide you with coping tools,  and
      help you change the way you think and manage your anxiety so that you can
      eliminate those pesky racing thoughts.


      ## Eating Disorders


      Having an eating disorder can be exhausting and lonely. It may feel at
      times as if your whole life has become consumed with thoughts about your
      weight, what you look like, your flaws, how others perceive you, what to
      eat during your binge sessions or how many calories you consumed that day.
      You may feel like you have little time to worry or think about anything
      else in your life, as you become trapped in the constant cycle of anxiety,
      fear, shame, and guilt. 


      When you have an eating disorder food is usually the first thought you
      have each morning and is the last thing you want to talk about with
      anyone. It may feel isolating as you hide the symptoms of your disorder
      from your friends or family, or tell the people in your life, only to find
      that they don’t truly understand what its like to have an eating disorder.
      You're not alone. Many people struggle with issues concerning their body
      image, and relationship to food, they just don’t talk about it. Whether
      you have been diagnosed with an eating disorder or are just beginning to
      notice symptoms of an eating disorder, therapy with an individual like me,
      who specializes in eating disorders can help. During therapy we will look
      at your disordered eating patterns, and your emotions and find and work
      through the underlying causes of your eating disorder so that you can
      become healthy and regain control of your life again.


      ## Other Specialties


      In addition to anxiety and eating disorders, I have an extensive
      background treating addition, autism, and some other things I’ll go over
      in another novel. What’s the last book you’ve read? What’s the last meal
      you’ve eaten? How about the last movie you’ve seen? If you want answers to
      these questions and so many others, hook yourself up to an e-meter and
      have a spin at some pseudoscience. Wait, that’s something else.
