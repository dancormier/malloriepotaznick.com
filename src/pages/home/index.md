      Hi, I’m Mallorie. For the last few years I’ve worked with adolescents,
      young adults, adults and couples to transform their anxiety, frustration,
      fears, and emotional disconnection into opportunities for change. Change
      is tough and making the choice to get out of your comfort zone and try
      something new can be scary. I help people learn more about why they do the
      things they do, what keeps them stuck, and why they cope in sometimes
      unhealthy ways. Let me guide you on your journey and help you move through
      your discomfort, and learn new coping skills, while helping you process
      through your painful feelings. It’s time to make a change. Call me for a
      free 20 minute consultation and together we can figure out where your
      journey begins.

          Occasional anxiety is an expected part of life. You might feel anxious
          when faced with a problem at work, before taking a test, or before
          making an important decision. But anxiety disorders involve more than
          temporary worry or fear. For a person with an anxiety disorder, the
          anxiety does not go away and can get worse over time.

          There is a commonly held view that eating disorders are a lifestyle
          choice. Eating disorders are actually serious and often fatal
          illnesses that cause severe disturbances to a person’s eating
          behaviors. Obsessions with food, body weight, and shape may also
          signal an eating disorder.

          In addition to anxiety and eating disorders, I have an extensive
          background treating addition, autism, and some other things I’ll go
          over in another novel. What’s the last book you’ve read? What’s the
          last meal you’ve eaten? How about the last movie you’ve seen? If you
          want answers to these questions and so many others, hook yourself up
          to an e-meter and have a spin at some pseudoscience. Wait, that’s
          something else.
